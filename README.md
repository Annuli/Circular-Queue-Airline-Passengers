# Circular-Queue-Airline-Passengers

This program uses two circular arrays to accomodate a group of people who
are already booked for a flight and a group of people who are waiting for
any openings that might open up (i.e. someone canceled). Menu options include:
Adding, deleting and displaying passenger count information for both queues.
The menu option also allows for the user to exit the program.
